* Notes on the fish game

* Ideas
** Fish come to "tank" if there is a lot of food
  - find food and feed it to fish as clicking mechanism
  - fish enter the "tank" through ths sides
  - catch the fish in the tank!
  - stock the tank by buying fish
  - don't overfish the tank!!
** Fish hatch from eggs
- start with one egg
** Buy different kinds of fish eggs
** Fish can lay eggs
- females only?
** display time passed in window
** Catch fish 
   - use hooks
   - upgrade hook types
   - upgrade to nets
   - upgrade to dynamite?   seems fishy ... hahaha!

** Start by fishing with bare hook
*** Catch minnows, bugs to use as bait
*** Cut up fish for bait
** Buy / Sell Fish
 - which fish gets sold?
 - sell by type?
 - sell by value?
   - do different fish have value?
 - only sell fish that get caught?
** Fish grow and are worth more
** Buy / Sell bait, worms, bugs

* Types of fish
- unlock fish types as you grow
** trout
** goldfish
** salmon
** Bottom Feeders (flounder/halibut)
** Top feeders?
** quick vs slow
** Crabs, etc?


* Tell the story in the log (right hand column)
